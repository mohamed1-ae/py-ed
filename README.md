# py-ed, an Ed-like python text editor.


### about:

This is an Ed-like file editor made in python that
took me around 15 minutes to develop thus it may 
be a bit rough around the edges when it comes to
features and usage, feel free to add pull requests
to contribute to this project.


### Requirements:

`python 3.x`


### Usage:

add the path of your python binary in this format
`!#path/to/binary` at the top of your copy of the
py-ed file, then add the name of the file that you
want to edit as the first argument in this format
`./py-ed.py filename`.
